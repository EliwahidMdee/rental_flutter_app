## 🏗️ Architecture

The mobile app follows **Clean Architecture** principles:

```
┌──────────────────────┐
│  Presentation Layer  │  ← Screens, Widgets, State Management
├──────────────────────┤
│  Business Logic      │  ← Use Cases, Business Rules
├──────────────────────┤
│  Data Layer          │  ← API Client, Repositories, Models
└──────────────────────┘
```

## 🔑 Key Technologies

- **Backend API:** Laravel (existing)
- **Authentication:** Laravel Sanctum (token-based)
- **State Management:** Provider (recommended), or Riverpod/Bloc
- **Local Storage:** Hive + Flutter Secure Storage
- **Networking:** Dio HTTP client
- **Routing:** GoRouter

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue:** `flutter doctor` shows errors
- **Solution:** Follow the specific error messages and install missing components

**Issue:** API calls return 401 Unauthorized
- **Solution:** Check token storage, ensure token is being sent in headers

**Issue:** Unable to connect to local backend
- **Solution:** 
  - Android Emulator: Use `http://10.0.2.2:8000/api`
  - iOS Simulator: Use `http://localhost:8000/api`
  - Physical devices: Use your computer's local IP

**Issue:** Build errors after adding dependencies
- **Solution:** Run `flutter pub get` and `flutter clean`, then rebuild

**Issue:** Hot reload not working
- **Solution:** Try hot restart (Shift+R) or full restart
